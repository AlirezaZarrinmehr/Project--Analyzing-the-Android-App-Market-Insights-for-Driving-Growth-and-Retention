# Project--The-Android-App-Market-on-Google-Play

The project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market, which is a rapidly growing industry that has revolutionized the way people interact with technology. With mobile apps becoming ubiquitous and easy to create, it is essential to analyze the market to gain insights that can help to drive growth and retention. The analysis involves comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories and working with two files: apps.csv and user_reviews.csv.

The data cleaning process is an essential step in the analysis, as it ensures that the data is in a format that is usable for subsequent calculations. In the case of this project, the Installs and Price columns in the apps.csv file need to be cleaned to remove special characters so that the columns can contain only digits. The project also involves correcting data types to make Installs and Price numeric and working with the four features, Installs, Size, Rating, and Price.

The analysis includes exploring app categories to determine which category has the highest share of (active) apps in the market, whether any specific category dominates the market, and which categories have the fewest number of apps. The project finds that Family and Game apps have the highest market prevalence, but Tools, Business, and Medical apps are also at the top. The project also examines the distribution of app ratings to determine how all the apps perform on average, and it finds that the majority of the apps are highly rated.

The project analyzes the relationship between app size and price, and it finds that the majority of top-rated apps range from 2 MB to 20 MB, while the vast majority of apps price themselves under $10. The project also examines the relationship between app category and app price, finding that Medical and Family apps are the most expensive, and all game apps are reasonably priced below $20.

The project also filters out "junk" apps that don't have a purpose and examines the popularity of paid vs. free apps. It finds that paid apps have a relatively lower number of installs than free apps, but the difference is not as stark as expected. Finally, the project conducts sentiment analysis of user reviews to determine how people feel about the app. It finds that free apps receive a lot of harsh comments, while paid apps never receive extremely negative reviews, which may indicate that paid apps are of higher quality.

The project provides a comprehensive overview of the Android app market, which is useful for anyone looking to gain insights into the market. The findings can help developers to develop strategies to drive growth and retention, make informed decisions about pricing, and create high-quality apps that meet users' needs.
